---------- CREEP DODGER ---------
HOW THE GAME WORKS --
Navigate through the game board to get to your friend while avoiding the dancing creeps.

- Use  the WASD keys to move up, right, down, and left.
- Once you collide into a creep then the game ends and it will ask you to try again.
- Once you get to your friend at the bar, you win and it'll ask you if you want to play again.

TECH

PROBLEMS I RAN INTO
- I had a terrifyingly hard time with making the player not be able to run into the walls and have the game not end. I spend so much time with the walls that I did not have time to start making my game look the way that I wanted to.

STRECH GOALS
- I started working on a switch statements in order to make more levels. If I had more time, I would like to work on clearing the board once you win and it'll prompt you to start the next level with a new layout and more creeps.
