---------- CREEP DODGER ---------
BASIC GAME
Help Tin avoid all of the creepers by leading her to her friend at the bar. 

TECH
I want to use basic html canvas, CSS, and javascript for the gameboard and logic.

MVP
- Intro/instructions to the game with a "start" button
- Win/Loss conditions
- Use keys to move "hero" (which will be my face) around on gameboard
- Reset button

STRETCH GOALS
- Prettify my game 
- Create level ups and add more creeps with each level 
- Make different layouts for different levels?
- Give a time limit to when you need to reach the bar by before your friend gets drunk
